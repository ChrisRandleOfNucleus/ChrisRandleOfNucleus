- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris Randle, and my username is @ChrisRandleOfNucleus. I am a ASP.NET full-stack Senior Developer who specialises in Content Management Systems and C# together with Test Driven Development using .NET (Core, Standard and Framework).
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much about the Microsoft stack of technologies as possible, especially but not exclusively, around Web-based technologies. This often includes cross-over technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla ECMAScript), jQuery, and the Single Page Application technologies like React, Angular, Vue, etc. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Identity Server, computer security, Test Driven Development (including Unit Testing, Integration-Testing, Functional-Testing, and Regression-Testing), etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate personallyu on any C# projects for charitable causes. Professionally, Nuclues, as an agency, can help with any of your CMS needs (WordPress, Umbraco, Sitecore, Kentico, AxCMS, DotNetNuke, and bespoke CMS'). 
- 📫 How to reach me? Contact me on Twitter, LinkedIn, or [email me](mailto:crandle@nucleus.co.uk)
